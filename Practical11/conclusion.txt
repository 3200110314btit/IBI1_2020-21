the	percentage of identical	amino acids	for human and mouse is 89.68609865470853 and alignment score 1091.
the	percentage of identical	amino acids	for human and randomseq is 5.829596412556054 and alignment score -250.
the	percentage of identical	amino acids	for randomseq and mouse is 6.278026905829597 and alignment score -250.
the bigger percentage of these two species are, the more similar of these two species are.
and the score higher, these two species are more similar
Thus, the amino of human and mouse is huge similar. The mouse and human are hugely differed with randomseq and Highly evolved.
